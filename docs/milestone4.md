## PlanIt - The Scheduling App! ##
### CS326 Spring 2020 ###
------

### Overview: What is PlanIt? ###
The idea with PlanIt is to innovate a new type of scheduling app. See, there are a ton of apps and websites on the internet that let you write down the things you need to do and check them off. What makes PlanIt different is the greedy job-scheduling algorithm! PlanIt takes into account all of your due dates, expected times of completion, and other things to focus you in on one task to do - the optimal one. What task makes most sense to do right now? PlanIt - the smart planner.

This is your home page on PlanIt. At the top of the page you see a calendar which has your schedule on it as well as due dates. Look further down and see your feed with all the assignments you have entered, sorted by optimal completion order with all the information you need at a glance. To your right, you can add or delete courses.
