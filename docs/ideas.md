### Innovative Idea ###
A website that helps you manage academic workload by inputing your classes, exam schedule, and assignments. It would give you rundowns on what assignments you need to do today, the the near future, in the distant future, and it would help notify you when youâ€™re in over your head and are about to procrastinate too much. 

### Important Components ###
Users will be faced with a login page when they first arrive to the page. After they input their username and password, they will be faced with their dashboard.

Each user's dashboard will contain two main components - a feed containing their assignments (possibly with different density views), and a calendar with important events an assignments marked. The assignment section will present the user with the suggested order of assignments, based on a job allocation algorithm, as well as some suggestions on ways to break it up.

This data will be stored in a MongoDB containing five documents:

- user (name, pw - hashed), 
- class (name, location, prof, schedule, office hours), 
- extracurricular (name, location, schedule), 
- assignment (name, class, assign date, due date, expected time to complete, notes), and 
- exam (name, class, start time, notes)

Users will be able to query this MongoDB to look for the specific information they need, but the system will also automatically show things it deems necessary.
