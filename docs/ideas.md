### Innovative Idea ###
A website that helps you manage academic workload by inputing your classes, exam schedule, and assignments. It would give you rundowns on what assignments you need to do today, the the near future, in the distant future, and it would help notify you when youâ€™re in over your head and are about to procrastinate too much. 

### Important Components ###
We'll use a database to store assignment objects and implement a way for users to query that database in a meaningful way. The system will also check for certain markets, i.e. things due and things done, to offer advice and suggestions. We will also implement a log-in system for multiple users to be able to use the service from any computer.
